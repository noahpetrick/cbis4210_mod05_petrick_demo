<h1>About</h1>
<p>In the heart of Georgia, on a campus where people marveled at the mysteries of finance and technology, there lived a student named Noah, the undisputed master of loan amortization and college-grade averages. While most students struggled through equations and database syntax, Noah seemed to possess an almost mystical understanding of numbers, calculating the most complex formulas in his head faster than others could on their laptops. Yet, despite his knack for math and code, even Noah couldn’t have anticipated how his talents would one day save the Pope.

It began on an ordinary Tuesday. Noah was deep in his coursework, working out a particularly tricky amortization schedule for a theoretical loan project. He was setting up a Flask app that could handle dynamic inputs for interest rates, loan terms, and payment frequencies, and he was almost there when his phone rang.

“Noah Petrick?” a voice inquired, both nervous and urgent.

“Yes, this is he,” Noah replied, slightly baffled.

“This is Father Alfonso from the Vatican,” the voice continued, “We’ve been told you’re the best in America when it comes to loan amortization and academic averaging. We… need your help.”

Before he knew it, Noah was on a private jet to Rome, his laptop in hand and a puzzled grin on his face. As he stepped off the plane and into the cobbled streets of Vatican City, Father Alfonso explained the dire situation.

“The Pope,” he began in a hushed voice, “is in financial trouble. The Vatican’s accounts are in disarray, especially the loan payments for our charities. We can’t keep up with the debt. And—there’s another issue.” Father Alfonso hesitated. “The Pope recently enrolled in a special university course, a private endeavor, and he’s determined to pass. But… his average grade is at risk.”

Noah nodded. He was here to do what he did best.

Over the next few days, Noah dove into the Vatican’s records. His Python scripts organized and amortized the loans, redistributing payments in ways that allowed the Vatican to continue funding its charities while staying on top of debt. His Flask app gave the finance team real-time insights, allowing them to calculate monthly payments with precision.

But his greatest challenge was the Pope’s GPA.

The Pope had taken on a rigorous course load, and the professors hadn’t gone easy on him. He was just a few points shy of passing. Noah knew he couldn’t simply change the grades—integrity was everything. But then he had an idea: he would teach the Pope to improve.

Each evening, Noah met with His Holiness, going over the coursework and breaking down complex concepts into relatable, everyday examples. He used parables about ancient philosophers, stories about finance and faith, and soon, the Pope’s understanding grew. In a month, he was acing his assignments, and his GPA averaged out to a respectable B.

By the end of his stay, Noah had become somewhat of a legend in the Vatican. The Vatican’s loans were balanced, and the Pope was on track to complete his course with honors. On the day of his departure, the Pope himself came to bid Noah farewell, thanking him not only for his knowledge but for his dedication.

“Noah, you may not wear a crown or a robe, but you are a true shepherd of wisdom,” the Pope said, placing a hand on his shoulder.

With a humble nod, Noah returned to Georgia, where he became known as the “Savior of the Vatican” among his friends. His talents had taken him across the world, helped save an institution, and, above all, showed him that numbers could truly change lives—even save them.

From that day on, whenever he logged into his Flask app or calculated another average, Noah couldn’t help but smile, knowing his work was more than numbers on a screen—it was, somehow, a little bit of magic.</p>
